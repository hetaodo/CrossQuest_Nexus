CrossQuest: Nexus

**CrossQuest: Nexus** is an innovative cross-APK interactive game that allows players to transfer game progress between multiple independent games. Players can transfer data and complete tasks between different games, such as opening a door in Game A and collecting keys to unlock it in Game B.

## Project Overview

The core concept of this project is to use broadcast mechanisms to transfer progress between different games, creating a brand new multi-game interactive experience. Each game (e.g., Game A, Game B) runs as a separate APK, but they can only transfer information and progress within the same system.

### Key Features:
- **Multi-Game**: By broadcasting data, game branches can share progress (e.g., quest status, item collection, etc.).
- **Game Installation Guide**: A single Android app guides users through installing and launching all game APKs.
- **Cross-APK Data Transfer**: Using Android's broadcast mechanism, Game A and Game B can exchange data.
- **Open Source Project**: All code is publicly available, and contributions and participation are welcome.

## Technology Stack

- **Android Studio**: For developing the game installation guide app, game branches, and cross-APK communication.
- **Java**: For developing Android native components.
- **BroadcastReceiver**: For inter-game communication and data transfer.
- **SharedPreferences/SQLite**: For storing game progress data.

## Directory Structure

- `/game-a`: Game A's project.
- `/game-b`: Game B's project.
- `/game-install-guide`: Android app for guiding game installation.
- `/assets`: Common game asset files (such as images, sound effects, etc.).

## How to Get Started

### Installation and Running
1. Clone the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/hetaodo/CrossQuest_Nexus.git
```

2. The directories "game-a", "game-b", and "game-install-guide" are automatically generated by Android Studio and can be compiled directly.

### Usage Rules
1. This repository app is compatible with Android 7.0 (API level 24) and higher.
2. The app installation function in `/game-install-guide` identifies files in assets. The code automatically generates a layout.
