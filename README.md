# CrossQuest_Nexus
CrossQuest: Nexus is an innovative cross-APK game where players transfer progress between independent games (Game A, Game B). Using Android's broadcast system, players complete tasks in one game and transfer progress to another, creating a unique interactive experience. This project is open-source and welcomes contributions.
